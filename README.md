# Scikit-learn_california_house_dataset_SGDRegressor

Basic SGDRegressor Model using Scikit-Learn Machine Learning library. THe model is trained using the Scikit-Learn California housing price dataset and predicts the median price of a house based on the following features:
1) MedInc median income in block group
2) HouseAge median house age in block group
3) AveRooms average number of rooms per household
4) AveBedrms average number of bedrooms per household
